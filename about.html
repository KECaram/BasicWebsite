        <h3>Reviews</h3>
          <p>"Fusing mundane objects with the abstract and surreal, MarlaJane uses a belnd of evocative colors and imperfect lines to create images that are as unnerving as they are aesthetically pleasing." - Captain P's Art Review Journal</p>

        <h1> About the Artist </h1>
          <p>My name is Keith Caram, and I guess this is a fan website. Marla is my sister and this is a website that I am making that is dedicated to her art and performances. 
            She is kind and passionate and a really great sister, so this is a little thing that I made to show my pride in her work. Not all of the information on the site is true, 
            but all of the art featured on this website is her art. She has been an artist as long as I can remember and has always made the most amazing art, especailly when featuring
            her family and cats. She recently moved back to MA from NYC and I miss her dearly. I hope you share in some of the joy that her art has given me!
          </p>
          <h1> <a id="triggerMissionStatement" href="#">Read Marla's Artist Mission Statement(click me!)</a></h1>
          <div id="MissionStatement">
            <h1>Marla's mission statement is probably something along the lines of:</h1>
            <p>Diversity, Empathy, and Inclusion always create the best art.</p>
            <p>Don't make something if it isn't socially relevent and full of love.</p>
            <p>The above is definitely speculation because I am her brother</p>
            <p>and I have no idea what's in her heart of hearts.</p>
